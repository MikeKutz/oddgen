Personal Issue List
-------------------
Issues during development, to be fixed later.

- Connection state is not refreshed, when connection has been closed (requires some events on dockable windows)
  Probably need to register some close event

- Refresh List of Connections somehow. Currently the list contains all connections a start time of oddgen navigator window

- Make all SQL statements compatible to older Oracle Database versions. Should run against 9.2.0.8
